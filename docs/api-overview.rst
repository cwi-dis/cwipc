Programming interfaces
======================

``cwipc`` provides a stable, language‑neutral API for working with point cloud
frames.  The core object is a ``cwipc_pointcloud`` handle representing a collection of 3D
points with colour and metadata.

General
-------

The ``cwipc_pointcloud`` is the central object, representing a point cloud. It is an opaque handle that can
be passed around between different components and across language boundaries with
minimal copying. When used from C or C++ the user is responsible for managing the lifetime of the object and calling
``cwipc_pointcloud_free()`` when finished.  In Python and C#, the bindings take care of
this automatically, with a caveat: if your intention is that ownership of the point
cloud passes to some other component in some other language, which will henceforth be
responsible for it, you must call ``cwipc_detach()``, and pass the resulting handle to 
the other component. This will invalidate the old handle (so it can't be used later, and it
won't be freed when the Python/C# object is garbage collected), and transfer ownership to the new component, 
which will be responsible for freeing it.

The ``cwipc_source`` interface represents a source of point clouds, such as a camera, network stream decoder, synthetic generator or prerecorded point cloud sequence.  
It provides a common interface for waiting for the next available point cloud, and for retrieving it as a ``cwipc_pointcloud`` object.
Most sources (such as cameras, or recordings) will provide an extended interface ``cwipc_activesource`` which has methods to start and stop the source and to get additional metadata such
as the number of cameras used in the source and their positions and names.

The ``cwipc_sink`` interface represents a destination for point clouds, such as a network stream encoder, or display window. It provides a common interface for sending point clouds to the sink, and for controlling the sink (for example starting and stopping it).

All language bindings follow the same semantic model, with the C++ bindings being the most direct, so knowledge gained in one
language transfers easily to others. The bindings automatically handle lifetime
management and resource cleanup.

Language Bindings
-----------------

Bindings are available for the following languages:

* **C++ and C** – main header ``cwipc_util/api.h`` (includes both C and C++ interfaces)
  and the ``cwipc_util`` library.
* **Python** – package installed as ``cwipc`` (see ``cwipc_pymodules_install.sh``).
* **C#** – used primarily from Unity via the companion
  `cwipc_unity <https://github.com/cwi-dis/cwipc_unity>`_ repository.
