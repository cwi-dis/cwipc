Programming interfaces
======================

``cwipc`` provides a stable, language‑neutral API for working with point cloud
frames.  The core object is a ``cwipc`` handle representing a collection of 3D
points with colour and metadata.

Bindings are available for the following languages:

* **C++** – header ``cwipc_util/include/cwipc_util.hpp`` and the ``cwipc_util`` library.
* **C** – header ``cwipc_util/include/cwipc.h`` and corresponding static/dynamic
  libraries.
* **Python** – package installed as ``cwipc`` (see ``cwipc_pymodules_install.sh``).
* **C#** – used primarily from Unity via the companion
  `cwipc_unity <https://github.com/cwi-dis/cwipc_unity>`_ repository.

The sections below provide a brief introduction and point to API reference
material generated by Doxygen.
