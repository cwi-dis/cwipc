# Preparing a Distribution

Whether you are creating a release for end users or building packages for a
custom environment, the following guidelines apply.

## Versioning

The version string is controlled by the `CWIPC_VERSION` CMake variable.  Set
it in `CMakeUserPresets.json` or when configuring the build:

```sh
cmake -DCWIPC_VERSION=1.2.3 ..
```

The `CHANGELOG.md` file should be updated with all user‑visible changes prior
to tagging a release.

## Binary packages

* **macOS:** Build a Homebrew formula (`homebrew-cwipc` repository) that refers
to the tarball generated by `cpack` (the CMake packaging tool).  The formula
runs `brew install` which unpacks the tarball into the Cellar.
* **Windows:** Use the installer scripts under `scripts/` to construct a
  self‑extracting `.exe` with NSIS.  The `CMakeLists.txt` contains the
  necessary `CPack` configuration.
* **Ubuntu/Debian:** Use `cpack` with the `DEB` generator or create a custom
  `deb` using `dpkg-deb` similar to the existing release workflow.

The command `cmake --build build --target package` (after a successfully
configured build) will create tar, deb, or other packages depending on the
`CPack` generators that are enabled.

## Source releases

`cpack` can also create a source tarball:

```sh
cmake --build build --target package_source
```

This tarball contains the full Git tree with submodules and can be used by
downstream packagers.

## Python modules

The `cwipc_pymodules_install.sh` (and Windows `.bat`) script installs the
python extensions into the active environment.  For distribution we release
wheel files and upload them to PyPI under the `cwipc` package name.

## Continuous integration

The project uses GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/build.yml`) to build and
package on every push.  Tags matching `v*` trigger a release job which uploads
artifacts to GitHub Releases and updates the Homebrew formula.
